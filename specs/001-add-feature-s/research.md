# Research: Claude Code MCP Registry Integration

**Research Date**: 2025-09-16
**Research Scope**: Claude Code integration patterns, configuration management,
                    error handling, and MCP server installation procedures

## Research Findings

### 1. Claude Code MCP Tool Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Use MCP server-based integration with `mcp__registry__` tool naming convention

**Rationale**:

- Claude Code has mature, standardized MCP integration patterns
- MCP servers provide the most natural integration path for registry functionality
- Follows established naming conventions (`mcp__<server_name>__<tool_name>`)
- Enables both programmatic and conversational interfaces

**Alternatives considered**:

- Standalone CLI tool (rejected: doesn't integrate with Claude Code's
  conversation flow)
- Direct API integration (rejected: no standardized pattern for this)
- Custom plugin system (rejected: MCP is the established extension mechanism)

### 2. Claude Code Configuration Management Patterns

**Decision**: Support three configuration scopes: local (default), project, and user

**Rationale**:

- Claude Code has well-defined scope hierarchy: local ‚Üí project ‚Üí user
- Local scope is default and private to user within project directory
- Project scope uses `.mcp.json` files for team collaboration
- User scope for cross-project utility servers
- Established CLI patterns for scope selection

**Alternatives considered**:

- Global-only configuration (rejected: doesn't match Claude Code patterns)
- Project-only configuration (rejected: limits flexibility)
- Custom configuration system (rejected: breaks compatibility)

**Configuration Scope Details**:

```bash
# Local scope (default) - private to user in current project
claude mcp add registry-client /path/to/server

# Project scope - shared team configuration in .mcp.json
claude mcp add --scope project registry-client /path/to/server

# User scope - accessible across all projects
claude mcp add --scope user registry-client /path/to/server
```

### 3. Claude Code Error Handling and User Feedback Conventions

**Decision**: Use structured error responses with `is_error` flag and descriptive messages

**Rationale**:

- Claude Code expects specific error response format
- Graceful degradation prevents conversation breaking
- Structured logging with context preservation
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

**Error Response Format**:

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Error message with context and suggested actions"
    }
  ],
  "is_error": true
}
```

**User Feedback Patterns**:

- Progressive disclosure: start with summaries, allow drilling down
- Natural language responses formatted for human readability
- Error context with actionable next steps
- Status indicators and progress feedback

### 4. MCP Server Installation Procedures and Validation

**Decision**: Leverage Claude Code's built-in MCP management with validation hooks

**Rationale**:

- Claude Code has robust MCP server lifecycle management
- Atomic writes prevent configuration corruption
- Built-in validation and error checking
- Immediate effect of configuration changes
- OAuth token management and auto-reconnection

**Installation Flow**:

1. Validate server identifier and availability
2. Prompt user for configuration scope choice
3. Use `claude mcp add` with appropriate scope
4. Validate installation success
5. Provide user feedback and next steps

**Validation Approaches**:

- Pre-installation: Check server exists in registry
- During installation: Validate configuration syntax
- Post-installation: Verify server connectivity
- Error recovery: Provide rollback options

### 5. User Interaction Patterns for Configuration Choices

**Decision**: Use conversational prompts with clear options and defaults

**Rationale**:

- Claude Code users expect natural language interactions
- Clear choice presentation with explanations
- Sensible defaults (local scope) to minimize friction
- Escape hatches for advanced users

**Prompt Pattern**:

```text
I found the MCP server '{server_name}' in the registry.

Where would you like to install it?

üîí **Local** (recommended): Private to you in this project only
üìÅ **Project**: Shared with your team (adds to .mcp.json)
üåê **User**: Available across all your projects

Choose local, project, or user (default: local):
```

### 6. Integration Architecture Design

**Decision**: Extend existing MCP registry client with Claude Code-specific MCP server

**Rationale**:

- Leverages existing, tested registry client code
- Follows library-first architecture from constitution
- Minimal abstraction layer
- Direct integration with Claude Code's MCP system

**Architecture**:

```text
mcp_registry_client/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude_integration.py    # New: Claude Code MCP server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude_tools.py         # New: Tool implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.py              # Existing: Core registry client
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py              # Extended: Claude-specific models

Claude Code Integration:
MCP Server ‚Üí claude_integration.py ‚Üí RegistryClient ‚Üí Registry API
```

### 7. Tool Interface Specifications

**Decision**: Implement three core tools with natural language interfaces

**Tools**:

1. `search_servers`: Natural language search with pagination
2. `get_server_info`: Detailed server information retrieval
3. `install_server`: Guided installation with scope selection

**Interface Pattern**:

```python
@tool("search_servers", "Search MCP servers in registry", {
    "query": z.string().optional(),
    "page": z.number().optional().default(1)
})
async def search_servers(args):
    # Implementation using existing RegistryClient
    pass
```

## Research Summary

Claude Code has a mature, well-established pattern for MCP integrations that
perfectly suits our registry client needs. The research confirms:

1. **MCP server-based integration** is the standard approach
2. **Three-tier configuration scopes** (local/project/user) are well-established
3. **Structured error handling** with conversational feedback is expected
4. **Natural language tool interfaces** with rich formatting are the norm
5. **Validation and lifecycle management** are handled by Claude Code infrastructure

Our implementation should follow these established patterns while leveraging the
existing registry client architecture. This approach ensures seamless
integration with Claude Code's ecosystem while maintaining the constitutional
requirements of library-first design and test-driven development.
