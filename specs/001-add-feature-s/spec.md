# Feature Specification: Claude Code MCP Registry Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-feature-s`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add feature(s) necessary for Claude Code to use
                              this project as a tool which the User can use directly."

User stories

- I want to be able to ask Claude Code to find an MCP server, e.g. "Find an MCP
  server for JIRA in the registry"
- I want to recieve a list of matching servers (if any match)
- I want to recieve a list of 10 items (or as many as match if <10)
- I want the list to be paginated
- I want to be able to continue from the list by telling Claude Code e.g. "OK,
  I'd like to try server 'foo/bar'"
- I want Claude Code to interpret "use" or "try" to mean installing the
  user-provided MCP server
- I want CLaude Code to ask whether the MCP server should ibe installed into the
  global config, or the project config"

## Execution Flow (main)

1. Parse user description from Input
   L If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   L Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   L Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   L If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   L Each requirement must be testable
   L Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   L If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   L If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for
   any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login
   system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable
   and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A Claude Code user wants to discover and install MCP servers from the registry
through natural language conversation. They can search for servers by name or
functionality, browse paginated results, select a specific server, and have
Claude Code install it into their configuration.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user asks "Find an MCP server for JIRA in the registry"
   **When** Claude Code processes the request
   **Then** Claude Code returns a list of matching servers containing name, abbreviated description, and metadata
2. **Given** search results contain more than 10 matches
   **When** the results are displayed
   **Then** Claude Code only lists 10 results at a time, with pagination indicators
3. **Given** a user sees search results
   **When** the user asks for more info
   **Then** Claude Code asks the registry for more info for {ORG}/{SERVER_NAME}
4. **Given** a user sees search results
   **When** they say "I'd like to try {ORG}/{SERVER_NAME}"
   **Then** Claude Code initiates the installation process
5. **Given** a user selects a server to install
   **When** the installation begins
   **Then** Claude Code asks the user whether to install to global or project configuration
6. **Given** pagination is available
   **When** a user requests more results,
   **Then** Claude Code displays the next page of results
7. **Given** the user makes a search
   **When** no results are returned
   **Then** Claude Code prompts the user with "The registry did not return any results."
8. **Given** the user selects a server for more info, or to install
   **When** the user provides a malformed server identifier
   **Then** Claude Code prompts the user with e.g. "{USER_INPUT} doesn't look like a server I have in my list. Did you mean {example}?"
9. **Given** the user selects a server for more info, or to install
   **When** the selected server is unavailable for any reason
   **Then** Claude Code prompts the user with "There seems to be a problem with {ORG}/{SERVER_NAME}. Perhaps check the registry's GitHub repo to see if it has been disabled.""

### Edge Cases

- [resolved with user story] What happens when no servers match the search query?
- [resolved with user story] How does the system handle malformed server identifiers?
- [resolved with user story] What occurs when a selected server is no longer available in the registry?
- How are network connectivity issues during search handled?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST enable Claude Code to search the MCP registry for
  servers based on natural language queries
- **FR-002**: System MUST return search results in a structured format that
  Claude Code can present to users
- **FR-003**: System MUST limit search results to 10 items per page by default
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide pagination capabilities for search results
  exceeding 10 items
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to select a specific server from search
  results using natural language
- **FR-006**: System MUST interpret keywords like "info", "detail", "full" as
  requests for a complete description
- **FR-007**: System MUST interpret keywords like "use", "try", "install" as
  installation requests
- **FR-008**: System MUST prompt users to choose between global and
  project-level configuration for installations
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide server metadata including name, abbreviated description,
  and version information in search results
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle cases where search queries return no results
  gracefully
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate server identifiers before attempting
  installation

### Key Entities

- **Search Query**: Natural language text describing desired MCP server
  functionality or name
- **Search Results**: Collection of matching servers with metadata, pagination
  info
- **MCP Server**: Registry entry containing name, description, installation
  details, and metadata
- **Installation Request**: User selection of a specific server with
  configuration preferences
- **Configuration Target**: Either global Claude Code config or project-specific
  config
