# MCP Registry Client Implementation Plan (Final)

Project Structure

- Modern Python package using uv for dependency management
- Python 3.12+ with comprehensive type hints
- Virtual environments for isolated development work
- Nox-based development workflow via noxfile.py
- All tool configurations in pyproject.toml

Core Components

1. Project Setup

- Initialize with uv init
- Create and activate virtual environment with uv venv and source .venv/bin/activate
- Configure pyproject.toml with:
  - Project metadata (name: mcp-registry-client)
  - Python 3.12+ requirement
  - Dependencies: httpx, pydantic
  - Dev dependencies: pytest, ruff, mypy, bandit, nox, mkdocs-material
  - Tool configurations for ruff, bandit, mypy, pytest, codecov

2. Development Workflow (Nox + venv)

- Virtual environment setup for isolation
- noxfile.py with sessions (each using isolated venvs):
  - lint - ruff check and format
  - type - mypy type checking
  - security - bandit security analysis
  - test - pytest with coverage
  - docs - mkdocs build/serve
  - quality - combined lint+type+security+test

3. Code Quality Tools

- Ruff: linting, checking, import sorting (configured in pyproject.toml)
- mypy: type checking
- bandit: security vulnerability scanning
- pytest: testing with coverage reporting
- codecov: coverage reporting (using provided config)
- markdownlint: markdown linting (using provided config)

4. Data Models (Pydantic)

- Server model for search results
- SearchResponse model for paginated API responses
- ServerDetail model for individual server details from get-server endpoint
- Full type safety with validation

5. HTTP Client (httpx)

- RegistryClient class with httpx.AsyncClient
- Base URL: `https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`
- Methods:
  - search_servers(name: str | None = None, page: int = 1) - search with name filter
  - get_server_by_name(name: str) - get server details by name (internal ID resolution)
- Pagination support and proper error handling

6. CLI Interface

- Commands:
  - `search [--name NAME] [--page PAGE]` - search servers
  - `info SERVER_NAME` - get detailed server info by name (not ID)
- Clean output formatting (JSON, table)
- Future: local filtering of results

7. Documentation (mkdocs)

- mkdocs-material for modern documentation
- API reference, usage examples, development guide
- Integrated with nox for easy building/serving

Implementation Steps

1. Project initialization with uv and virtual environment setup
2. Configure noxfile.py and all tools in pyproject.toml (using provided configs)
3. Research and model API schemas
4. Implement async HTTP client with name-based server lookup
5. Create CLI with search + info commands
6. Comprehensive testing and quality checks via nox
7. Documentation with mkdocs

The project will use virtual environments for clean, isolated development with
modern Python tooling and comprehensive quality checks.
